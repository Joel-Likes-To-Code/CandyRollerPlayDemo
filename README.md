# CandyRollerPlayDemo

## [Important!!] WebGL2.0

The game might be not run smoothly if you do not enable the WebGL2.0 on your chromium browser. Here is a link to an [Article](https://www.interplaylearning.com/en/help/how-to-enable-webgl-in-chrome) that allows you to fix that. Also make sure to allow the browser to enable the "Use hardware acceleration when available".
Make sure your graphic drivers are up to date too! :)

Due to the instability of running unity in the browser the game may vary by machine. 

This is the first game I have ever created. Candy Roller was created in just three days. I am proud of the progress I made in such a short time. I hope you get some enjoyment out of playing it.
