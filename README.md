## [Important!!] WebGL2.0

The game might be laggy if you do not enable the WebGL2.0 on your chromium browser. Here is a link to an [Article](https://www.interplaylearning.com/en/help/how-to-enable-webgl-in-chrome) that allows you to fix that. Also make sure to allow the browser to enable the "Use hardware acceleration when available".
Make sure your graphic drivers are up to date too! :)


## How to play
Click on the link located on the github pages on the right side of the repository.

## Gameplay Instructions
Move and jump your way to the goal, avoid any obstacles in your way!

## Controls
The actual controls will be WASD to move an spacebar to jump. Possible power up.
